# Simplification de la Génération de Fichiers (Phase 24)

## Goal Description
Analyze and refactor the file generation process to eliminate the creation of two separate files ("0-SGQ..." and "6-Suivi..."), which is a source of bugs and confusion. The goal is to produce a single, robust tracking file or a cleaner sequential generation process.

## User Review Required
> [!IMPORTANT]
> This plan is currently in the **ANALYSIS** phase. The proposed solution will be detailed after reviewing the code.
