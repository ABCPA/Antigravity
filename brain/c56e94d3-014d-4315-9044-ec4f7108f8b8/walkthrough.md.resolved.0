# Walkthrough - Dockerized MCP Environment

I have successfully created the "Audit-grade" Docker environment for your MCP servers.

## 📂 Deliverables

The following files were created in `c:\VBA\SGQ 1.65\docker-mcp\`:

1.  **[docker-compose.yml](file:///c:/VBA/SGQ%201.65/docker-mcp/docker-compose.yml)**
    *   Defines `mcp-memory` (Knowledge Graph), `mcp-filesystem` (Secure Access), and `mcp-fetcher` (Web).
    *   configured to use `c:\VBA` as the project root.

2.  **[.env](file:///c:/VBA/SGQ%201.65/docker-mcp/.env)**
    *   Environment configuration file.

3.  **[README.md](file:///c:/VBA/SGQ%201.65/docker-mcp/README.md)**
    *   Complete guide on how to start the environment and connect your AI agent.

## ⚠️ Verification Results

I attempted to verify the Docker installation:
*   **Command**: `docker --version`
*   **Result**: ❌ `The term 'docker' is not recognized`

**Action Required**:
Please ensure **Docker Desktop** is installed and running, and that `docker.exe` is in your system PATH.
Once installed, you can simply run `docker-compose up -d` in the created folder.
