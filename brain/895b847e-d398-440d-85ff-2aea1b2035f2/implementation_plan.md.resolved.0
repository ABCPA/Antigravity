# Workspace Update and Phase Planning

Update the [CPA_Unified.code-workspace](file:///c:/Users/AbelBoudreau/Workspace_CPA_AI/CPA_Unified.code-workspace) file to point to the current conversation ID and plan the next steps of the project.

## Proposed Changes

### [Workspace Configuration]

#### [MODIFY] [CPA_Unified.code-workspace](file:///c:/Users/AbelBoudreau/Workspace_CPA_AI/CPA_Unified.code-workspace)
- Updated the path for "🧠 Antigravity Brain" to `C:/Users/AbelBoudreau/.gemini/antigravity/brain/38c0952b-538f-42ad-9b56-a1c6cc87aa8f`.

### [Documentation & Planning]

#### [MODIFY] [ARCHITECTURE_ET_PLAN.md](file:///c:/VBA/SGQ%201.65/docs/ARCHITECTURE_ET_PLAN.md)
- Verify if any part of Phase 15 remains.
- Propose **Phase 19 : Final Cleanup & Performance Audit**.

## Verification Plan

### Automated Tests
- None required for workspace update (manual check in VS Code).

### Manual Verification
- Verify that the "Antigravity Brain" folder in VS Code now points to the current conversation directory.
- Confirm with the user if they wish to proceed with Phase 19 or if they have other specific priorities for the scripts.
