# Implementation Plan - Project Maintenance & Documentation Cleanup

## Goal Description
The [ARCHITECTURE_ET_PLAN.md](file:///c:/VBA/SGQ%201.65/docs/ARCHITECTURE_ET_PLAN.md) file contains significant duplication (lines 1-204 vs 205+), likely due to a previous merge or copy-paste error. This plan aims to consolidate the file into a single, clean source of truth and verify the project's technical health.

## User Review Required
> [!NOTE]
> This is a maintenance task initiated automatically to fix documentation integrity. No code changes are planned, only documentation and verification.

## Proposed Changes

### Documentation
#### [MODIFY] [ARCHITECTURE_ET_PLAN.md](file:///c:/VBA/SGQ%201.65/docs/ARCHITECTURE_ET_PLAN.md)
- Remove duplicate "Phase 0" through "Phase 12" sections.
- Ensure the "Target Architecture Schema" is accurate and appears only once.
- Consolidate the "Backlog" and "Work Plan" sections.

### Validation
- Run `vba-files/scripts/test-vbide-and-compile.ps1` to confirm no regressions.

## Verification Plan
### Automated Tests
- `pwsh -File vba-files/scripts/test-vbide-and-compile.ps1`
- `git status` to ensure clean working directory before commit.
