# Walkthrough - Project Documentation Cleanup

I have cleaned up the project documentation to remove significant content duplication and verified the project's technical health.

## Changes

### Documentation
- **[ARCHITECTURE_ET_PLAN.md](file:///c:/VBA/SGQ%201.65/docs/ARCHITECTURE_ET_PLAN.md)**: Removed duplicate "Phase 0-12" section (approx. 150 lines) that was corrupting the file structure. Consolidated the Architecture Schema and Work Plan into a single, clean narrative.
- **Verification**: Confirmed [GEMINI.md](file:///c:/VBA/SGQ%201.65/GEMINI.md) integrity (no duplication found).

## Verification Results

### Automated Tests
- **Compilation Check**: `test-vbide-and-compile.ps1` passed successfully (Exit Code 0).
- **Manifest Check**: `vba-files/manifest.json` integrity verified during compilation.

## Next Steps
- The documentation is now clean and reliable for future planning steps.
