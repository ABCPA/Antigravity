# Walkthrough - QA Pipeline & Report

I have implemented the QA pipeline and generated a detailed report of the findings.

## Changes

### QA Report
- **File**: [logs/qa/QA_REPORT_SUMMARY.md](file:///c:/VBA/SGQ%201.65/logs/qa/QA_REPORT_SUMMARY.md)
- **Findings**: 11 Duplicate Declarations ("Ambiguous name detected").
- **Critical Issues**: `TrySetSheetVisibility` (Duplicated logic), `FolderExists` (Boilerplate).

## Next Steps
- **Refactoring**: Execute the remediations proposed in the QA report to clean up the codebase.
