# Walkthrough: Commit and Sync All on Main

I have successfully committed and synchronized all changes on the `main` branch for the `SGQ 1.65` workspace.

## Changes Made

### Cleanup & Maintenance
- Removed temporary Excel-generated file `0F782210`.
- Moved the recovery folder `vba-files/clean_source_20260203_141802/` to `vba-files/backups/` for safety (git-ignored).

### Version Control Updates
- Staged and committed the following infrastructure files:
    - [docs/VBA_AUDIT_LOG.md](file:///c:/VBA/SGQ%201.65/docs/VBA_AUDIT_LOG.md)
    - [scripts/install-pandoc.ps1](file:///c:/VBA/SGQ%201.65/scripts/install-pandoc.ps1)
    - [scripts/verify-import.ps1](file:///c:/VBA/SGQ%201.65/scripts/verify-import.ps1)
- Pushed the changes to the remote repository.
