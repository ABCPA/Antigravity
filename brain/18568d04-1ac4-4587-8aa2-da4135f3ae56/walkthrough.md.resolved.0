# Walkthrough - Verification of Fixes

I have completed the verification of the recent fixes and structure updates to the **SGQ 1.65** workspace.

## 1. MCP Health Check (`verify-mcp-health.ps1`)

The health check script was executed to validate the Docker-based MCP environment.

**Results:**
- **Status:** **SUCCESS**
- **Docker Service:** Active.
- **Containers:** All required containers (`mcp-markitdown`, `mcp-m365`, `mcp-github`, `mcp-filesystem`, `mcp-dockerhub`, `mcp-fetcher`, `mcp-memory`) are **UP**.
- **Network:** `mcp-network` detected and active.

> [!NOTE]
> Minor warnings regarding cgroup v1 deprecation and blkio throttle support were observed in the Docker output. These are environment-specific warnings and do not impact the functionality of the MCP servers.

## 2. VBA Compilation & VBIDE Access (`test-vbide-and-compile.ps1`)

The VBA environment validation script was run to ensure the project is compilable and "Audit-grade" compliant.

**Results:**
- **Status:** **SUCCESS**
- **VBIDE Access:** **Allowed** (Trust access enabled).
- **Compile State:** The project was found to be **already compiled/clean** (Compile button disabled).
- **Compilation Attempt:** Not required (Project clean).

## 3. Documentation Updates

I have updated the [ARCHITECTURE_ET_PLAN.md](file:///c:/VBA/SGQ%201.65/docs/ARCHITECTURE_ET_PLAN.md) to reflect the completion of **Phase 42** (Validation et Exploitation MCP) and added **Phase 43** (Consolidation et Vérification Finale).

```

## Conclusion

The workspace is in a healthy state:
1.  **Infrastructure:** MCP servers are running and accessible.
2.  **Codebase:** VBA code is clean, compiled, and adheres to structural requirements.
3.  **Documentation:** Project plan is synchronized with the latest state.

Verification is complete.
