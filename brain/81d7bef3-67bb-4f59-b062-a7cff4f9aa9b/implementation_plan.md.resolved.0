# Upgrade Pull Request Template for AI Collaboration

## Goal Description
Enhance the existing [PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md](file:///c:/VBA/SGQ%201.65/.github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md) to enforce stricter manual validation of AI-generated code, ensuring alignment with the project's "AI Collaboration Guide". This completes Phase 14 of the industrialization process.

## User Review Required
None. This is a documentation/process update.

## Proposed Changes

### Configuration
#### [MODIFY] [.github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md](file:///c:/VBA/SGQ%201.65/.github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md)
Update the "AI Collaboration & Quality Checklist" section to:
1.  Link to [docs/guides/GUIDE_COLLABORATION_IA.md](file:///c:/VBA/SGQ%201.65/docs/guides/GUIDE_COLLABORATION_IA.md).
2.  Add explicit items for visual/manual verification of AI code (hallucinations, logic).
3.  Add item for Manifest compliance (if modules added).

```markdown
