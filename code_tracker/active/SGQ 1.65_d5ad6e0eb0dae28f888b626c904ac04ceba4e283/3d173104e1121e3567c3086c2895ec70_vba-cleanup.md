---

1. Run the static analysis script:
// turbo
2. Run command: `powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File "c:\VBA\SGQ 1.65\vba-files\scripts\analyze-vba-structure.ps1"`
3. Review the output for:
   - Private procedures not called within their module.
   - Public procedures not called anywhere (cross-reference with `audit_all_macro_calls.csv` if available).
   - Variables declared but not used.
4. Suggest a cleanup plan (Comment out first, delete later).
